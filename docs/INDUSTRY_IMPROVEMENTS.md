## Implementation Notes

To implement these improvements, the following dependencies were added:

```bash
# Development Dependencies
npm install --save-dev @types/express @types/node @types/jest @types/supertest @types/swagger-jsdoc @types/swagger-ui-express @types/winston @types/joi @types/mongoose @types/mongodb-memory-server

# Production Dependencies
npm install --save express-rate-limit rate-limit-redis redis winston winston-daily-rotate-file joi swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express mongodb-memory-server mongoose
```
